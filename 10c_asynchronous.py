'''
Basically, we use asyncio.gather(*tasks) to inform the loop to wait for all tasks to finish. 
Since the coroutines will start at almost the same time, the program will run for only 1 second. 
Asyncio gather() wonâ€™t necessarily run the coroutines by order, although it will return an ordered list of results.
